            <br>
            <h3>I always liked to spend time on the computer since I was young, so when I had to choose which course I was going to take it seemed obvious to pick Informatics Engineering, so i did it.I applied to IPB(Instituto Politécnico de Bragança) and i go in! </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>There we learned several subjects, but the one that captivated me the most was web development, it gives us the possibility to be creative, to challenge ourselves with each project we build.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>After 4 years I graduated and then i decided to take a break to focus on myself and learn languages.Now, my goal is to keep learning and create new and fascinating projects to share with the world!. </h3>
            <br>
